 * Durability layer. localStorage stays the synchronous source of truth the

 *
 *  - Android occasionally clears WebView storage (updates, corruption);
 *    native preferences are untouched, and we restore from them on launch.
 *  - Android's auto-backup includes SharedPreferences (WebView data is
 *    excluded), so reinstalls and phone transfers recover data too.
 *
 * On the plain web build Preferences falls back to a localStorage shim,
 * which makes the mirror a harmless no-op copy.
